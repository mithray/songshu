## Introduction

This is basically an encrypted wrapper around the npm packages `inquirer` and `configstore` and put into one useful package. `songshu` provides the following features.

-   Security hardened. `songshu` encrypts everything in the configuration storage by default, prompting a user for password to use to seed the encryption key.
-   Convenient. `songshu` automatically stores answers received by `inquirer` into encrypted `configstore`.
-   Extra Convenient. If you provide an array of questions to `songshu` you can choose to have them only prompt the user if the answer is not already saved in storage.
-   Compatible with the extremely popular `configstore`. `songshu` is a friendly squirrel that plays well with others. `songshu` has been trained to mimic the behavior of config store in most cases. Not thoroughly tested, but the API exposes the same functions. If you switch to `songshu` you will need to reenter your config information.

## Installation

## Usage

The API is identical to the npm package `configstore`, so you can copy their examples except with some exceptions.

songshu = new Songshu(packageJson.name)
```
